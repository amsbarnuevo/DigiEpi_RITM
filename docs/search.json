    "text": "Background and Rationale\nAn outbreak of an infectious disease can have a tremendous effect on people’s health, national economy, and social wellbeing, thus early discovery of an infectious disease allows for local epidemic containment, reducing negative public health impact.\nTraditional outbreak detection of public health important organisms through the demographic review approach coupled with diagnostic information heavily rely on the phenotypic features of the organism.  This technique has limited resolution required to map the source of the outbreak and to demonstrate chains of transmission, since isolates were grouped together as “indistinguishable” members of the cluster. Advancements in molecular biology such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) overcome this limitation by allowing for identification of all genomic characteristics of the bacteria included in a cluster.\nThe Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reference Laboratory developed and is currently implementing the SaTScan and WGS enhanced outbreak investigation protocol. The reference laboratory analyzes the AMR surveillance data from its sentinel sites for clustering through SaTScan module of WHONET software(laboratory information management system). SaTScan is a free cluster-detection software application within WHONET used by epidemiologists globally to describe spatial clusters of infectious and chronic disease. The isolates from detected clusters are subsequently sequenced to provide evidence to inform the outbreak investigation.\nIn an outbreak investigation, the availability and completeness of clinical-epidemiological and genomic data are important to determine the potential source and trace the transmission of the outbreak. Today, there are various digital tools available to help data integration and visualization of surveillance data especially during outbreak investigation. The Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance (CGPS) at the University of Oxford’s Big Data Institute developed a number of web-based tools for data collection (Epicollect), bioinformatics analysis (Pathogenwatch), data integration (Dataflo) and visualization (Microreact).\nThe conduct of workshop/trainings aims to provide an avenue to showcase the contributions of the Philippine Antimicrobial Resistance Program to the country’s fight against AMR and to highlight the system data architecture of the program. Furthermore, this workshop plans to introduce the reference laboratory’s service of SaTScan and WGS guided outbreak investigation. Moreover, to promote awareness of various digital epidemiology tools for surveillance and outbreak investigation. It likewise aims to foster engagement of the relevant units of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine towards the significance of a data management, system architecture and use of digital epidemiology tools."

    "text": "Background\nAntimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is the change that occurs over time among bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites where these organisms no longer respond to medicines making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. [1] AMR is a serious public health threat because of its far reaching and serious implications in health care as well as economies. AMR hampers the control of infectious diseases because patients remain infectious for a longer time increasing the risk of spreading resistant microorganisms to others. AMR increases the cost of health care as more expensive therapies must be used when infections become resistant to first-line medicines. Infections due to resistant microorganisms increases economic burden to families and societies as it often results in longer duration of illness and treatment.\nThe DOH-ARSP is a sentinel laboratory-based antimicrobial resistance surveillance on aerobic bacteria from clinical specimens. Currently participating in the program are 24 sentinel sites, and 2 gonococcal surveillance sites, representing 16 out of the 17 regions of the country. The surveillance collects data on culture and antimicrobial susceptibility from its 24 sentinel sites and 2 gonococcal surveillance sites. Case finding is based on priority specimens sent routinely to sentinel sites laboratories for clinical purposes\nAll sentinel sites implement standard methods for culture and susceptibility testing based on the WHO Manual for the Laboratory Identification and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Bacterial Pathogens of Public Health Importance in the Developing World 3 and the updated Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) references for antibiotic susceptibility testing and quality control. Panel of antibiotics for testing are based on the latest CLSI recommendations. In the analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, an isolate is considered resistant to an antimicrobial agent when tested and interpreted as resistant (R) in accordance with the clinical breakpoint criteria based on the most recent Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) references for antibiotic susceptibility testing [2] The culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results are encoded using a database software called WHONET. WHONET is Windows-based database software developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance based at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston for the management and analysis of microbiology laboratory data with a special focus on the analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility test results. Using a standard format, routine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results are sent through automatic data transfer by the sentinel sites to the coordinating laboratory of the program – the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reference Laboratory (ARSRL) at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.\nThe ARSRL’s Data Management Unit manages the cleaning, analysis, storage and security of the program’s surveillance data. Sentinel sites likewise send isolates with unusual antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to ARSRL for phenotypic and genotypic confirmatory testing. At the reference laboratory, all isolates with unusual susceptibility patterns received for confirmatory testing are re-identified using both automated (Vitek) and conventional methods. Both minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) - via automated method (Vitek) and gradient E-test, and disk diffusion are employed in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. As indicated, additional testing is done for specific antibiotics which are not included in AST card in use in the reference laboratory and for susceptibility testing for specific bacteria such as N. gonorrhea which requires manual AST methods. Serotyping for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Salmonellae, Shigellae and Vibrio cholerae were done for 2022. Further, for 2022, select isolates with resistance phenotype which have not been previously reported or have been only rarely reported to date underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS) at the Antimicrobial Surveillance Reference Laboratory (ARSRL). The genomic characterization of these isolates is meant to allow for the understanding of resistance mechanisms of these isolates as well as their potential for spread in order to inform control and prevention measures. Beginning January 2018, sentinel sites transmit culture and susceptibility data daily to the reference laboratory (ARSRL) through ARSP ftp server using WinSCP. The automated data transfer facilitates prompt identification by the ARSRL of resistant isolates of public health importance as well the identification of clustering of cases and potential outbreaks among sentinel sites.                  \n SaTScan is a free cluster-detection software application embedded in WHONET which is used by epidemiologists globally to describe spatial clusters of infectious and chronic disease, as well as disease vectors and risk factors. The software can identify whether the infection is randomly distributed over space, overtime or over space and time. Moreover, it allows the evaluation of the statistical significance of disease cluster alarms. The study of Natale et al. (2017), in a health-care facility in Italy showed that WHONET-saTScan was able to detect higher number of potential outbreaks as compared with the traditional epidemiological approach of investigation.[3] Moreover, Huang et al. (2010) stated that  WHONET-SaTScan rapidly detected the two previously known gram negative pathogen clusters and identified six Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and four Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) clusters that were previously not recorded in the hospital facility.[4]\nThis software coupled with the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) are the emerging tools for outbreak investigation.  WGS refers to the construction of the complete nucleotide sequence of a bacterium. This technique enables the analysis of the entire DNA sequence of the genome including the non-coding regions of DNA. Moreover, it has the capacity to identify functionally important sequence variants that affects gene expression. The advantages and functionality of WGS delivers ultimate high resolution genotypic method which makes it a powerful approach for outbreak investigation together with epidemiological approach.\n\nInvestigation Objectives\n\nGeneral Objective\n\nTo utilize WGS to investigate clustering of isolates detected in sentinel sites.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nTo detect clustering of isolates in the sentinel sites through any of the following route:\n\nUsing WHONET SaTScan\nAlerts from site laboratory personnel\nAlerts from site IPCC\n\nTo perform whole genome sequencing on isolates included in select clusters detected and verified through SaTScan.\nTo evaluate the genomic characteristics of isolates in a cluster to confirm the occurrence of an outbreak.\n\n\n\n\nRationale/ Significance\nAn outbreak of an infectious disease can have a tremendous effect on people’s health, national economy, and social wellbeing, thus early discovery of an infectious disease allows for local epidemic containment, reducing negative public health impact. Routine epidemiological assessment alone may not sufficiently provide information to allow targeted control of the infection. The integration of machine learning such as SaTScan in laboratory management system in a surveillance program allows the real time spatio-temporal detection of bacterial isolate clustering.  Furthermore, coupled with the distinctive ability of whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses of these cluster isolates confirms the occurrence of an outbreak. The use of SaTScan and WGS allows the reference laboratory to document and provide laboratory confirmation of the circulating agent of HAI and its resistance profile as well as the routes of transmission.\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1. Initial Alerts on Cluster Detection\nThe initial detection of increase in number and/ or clustering of isolates at the sentinel sites can be through any of the following: a) weekly SaTScan analysis; b) alerts from site laboratory personnel; and c) alerts from site IPCC. Alerts from sentinel site laboratory and IPCC personnel can be through several means of communication including personal communication with an ARSRL staff via phone call, SMS, or email. Upon raising of alerts by sentinel site IPCC and laboratory personnel, sentinel sites will implement due response in accordance with their hospital’s policy. Cluster alerts from sentinel site will be further verified by ARSRL through the conduct of SaTScan analysis on the sentinel site’s regular data and results of the verification will be shared with the sentinel site.\n\n\n2. Verification of Alerts at ARSRL Using SaTScan\nThe Data Management Unit (DMU) of ARSRL routinely conducts the SaTScan analysis every Friday of the week on the WHONET data transferred by the sites on a daily basis. Primarily, in running the SaTScan in WHONET software, cluster alerts were determined with “resistance profile” as summary row input. To confirm the detection of cluster based on identical resistance profile, the analysis is on “resistance profile” with “include cluster alerts”. In Figure 1, the specific analysis method to be used is “Space-Time Uniform – Simulated prospective”. The “maximum cluster length” and “baseline data” will be set at 180 days and 730 days respectively. On the other hand, the “recurrence interval” will be set at 365 days and “Monte Carlo simulations” at 9999.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. SaTScan analysis default configuration\n\n\nSaTScan analysis is not limited to the organisms listed in Table 1.  Cluster detection can also be performed on other bacterial species of interest.\nTable 1.
