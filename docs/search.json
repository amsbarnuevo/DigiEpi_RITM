    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nAntimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is the change that occurs over time among bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites where these organisms no longer respond to medicines making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. [1] AMR is a serious public health threat because of its far reaching and serious implications in health care as well as economies. AMR hampers the control of infectious diseases because patients remain infectious for a longer time increasing the risk of spreading resistant microorganisms to others. AMR increases the cost of health care as more expensive therapies must be used when infections become resistant to first-line medicines. Infections due to resistant microorganisms increases economic burden to families and societies as it often results in longer duration of illness and treatment.\nThe DOH-ARSP is a sentinel laboratory-based antimicrobial resistance surveillance on aerobic bacteria from clinical specimens. Currently participating in the program are 24 sentinel sites, and 2 gonococcal surveillance sites, representing 16 out of the 17 regions of the country. The surveillance collects data on culture and antimicrobial susceptibility from its 24 sentinel sites and 2 gonococcal surveillance sites. Case finding is based on priority specimens sent routinely to sentinel sites laboratories for clinical purposes\nAll sentinel sites implement standard methods for culture and susceptibility testing based on the WHO Manual for the Laboratory Identification and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Bacterial Pathogens of Public Health Importance in the Developing World 3 and the updated Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) references for antibiotic susceptibility testing and quality control. Panel of antibiotics for testing are based on the latest CLSI recommendations. In the analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, an isolate is considered resistant to an antimicrobial agent when tested and interpreted as resistant (R) in accordance with the clinical breakpoint criteria based on the most recent Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) references for antibiotic susceptibility testing [2] The culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results are encoded using a database software called WHONET. WHONET is Windows-based database software developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance based at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston for the management and analysis of microbiology laboratory data with a special focus on the analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility test results. Using a standard format, routine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results are sent through automatic data transfer by the sentinel sites to the coordinating laboratory of the program – the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reference Laboratory (ARSRL) at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.\nThe ARSRL’s Data Management Unit manages the cleaning, analysis, storage and security of the program’s surveillance data. Sentinel sites likewise send isolates with unusual antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to ARSRL for phenotypic and genotypic confirmatory testing. At the reference laboratory, all isolates with unusual susceptibility patterns received for confirmatory testing are re-identified using both automated (Vitek) and conventional methods. Both minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) - via automated method (Vitek) and gradient E-test, and disk diffusion are employed in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. As indicated, additional testing is done for specific antibiotics which are not included in AST card in use in the reference laboratory and for susceptibility testing for specific bacteria such as N. gonorrhea which requires manual AST methods. Serotyping for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Salmonellae, Shigellae and Vibrio cholerae were done for 2022. Further, for 2022, select isolates with resistance phenotype which have not been previously reported or have been only rarely reported to date underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS) at the Antimicrobial Surveillance Reference Laboratory (ARSRL). The genomic characterization of these isolates is meant to allow for the understanding of resistance mechanisms of these isolates as well as their potential for spread in order to inform control and prevention measures. Beginning January 2018, sentinel sites transmit culture and susceptibility data daily to the reference laboratory (ARSRL) through ARSP ftp server using WinSCP. The automated data transfer facilitates prompt identification by the ARSRL of resistant isolates of public health importance as well the identification of clustering of cases and potential outbreaks among sentinel sites.                  \n SaTScan is a free cluster-detection software application embedded in WHONET which is used by epidemiologists globally to describe spatial clusters of infectious and chronic disease, as well as disease vectors and risk factors. The software can identify whether the infection is randomly distributed over space, overtime or over space and time. Moreover, it allows the evaluation of the statistical significance of disease cluster alarms. The study of Natale et al. (2017), in a health-care facility in Italy showed that WHONET-saTScan was able to detect higher number of potential outbreaks as compared with the traditional epidemiological approach of investigation.[3] Moreover, Huang et al. (2010) stated that  WHONET-SaTScan rapidly detected the two previously known gram negative pathogen clusters and identified six Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and four Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) clusters that were previously not recorded in the hospital facility.[4]\nThis software coupled with the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) are the emerging tools for outbreak investigation.  WGS refers to the construction of the complete nucleotide sequence of a bacterium. This technique enables the analysis of the entire DNA sequence of the genome including the non-coding regions of DNA. Moreover, it has the capacity to identify functionally important sequence variants that affects gene expression. The advantages and functionality of WGS delivers ultimate high resolution genotypic method which makes it a powerful approach for outbreak investigation together with epidemiological approach.\n\nInvestigation Objectives\n\nGeneral Objective\n\nTo utilize WGS to investigate clustering of isolates detected in sentinel sites.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nTo detect clustering of isolates in the sentinel sites through any of the following route:\n\nUsing WHONET SaTScan\nAlerts from site laboratory personnel\nAlerts from site IPCC\n\nTo perform whole genome sequencing on isolates included in select clusters detected and verified through SaTScan.\nTo evaluate the genomic characteristics of isolates in a cluster to confirm the occurrence of an outbreak.\n\n\n\n\nRationale/ Significance\nAn outbreak of an infectious disease can have a tremendous effect on people’s health, national economy, and social wellbeing, thus early discovery of an infectious disease allows for local epidemic containment, reducing negative public health impact. Routine epidemiological assessment alone may not sufficiently provide information to allow targeted control of the infection. The integration of machine learning such as SaTScan in laboratory management system in a surveillance program allows the real time spatio-temporal detection of bacterial isolate clustering.  Furthermore, coupled with the distinctive ability of whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses of these cluster isolates confirms the occurrence of an outbreak. The use of SaTScan and WGS allows the reference laboratory to document and provide laboratory confirmation of the circulating agent of HAI and its resistance profile as well as the routes of transmission.\n\n\nMethodology\n\n1. Initial Alerts on Cluster Detection\nThe initial detection of increase in number and/ or clustering of isolates at the sentinel sites can be through any of the following: a) weekly SaTScan analysis; b) alerts from site laboratory personnel; and c) alerts from site IPCC. Alerts from sentinel site laboratory and IPCC personnel can be through several means of communication including personal communication with an ARSRL staff via phone call, SMS, or email. Upon raising of alerts by sentinel site IPCC and laboratory personnel, sentinel sites will implement due response in accordance with their hospital’s policy. Cluster alerts from sentinel site will be further verified by ARSRL through the conduct of SaTScan analysis on the sentinel site’s regular data and results of the verification will be shared with the sentinel site.\n\n\n2. Verification of Alerts at ARSRL Using SaTScan\nThe Data Management Unit (DMU) of ARSRL routinely conducts the SaTScan analysis every Friday of the week on the WHONET data transferred by the sites on a daily basis. Primarily, in running the SaTScan in WHONET software, cluster alerts were determined with “resistance profile” as summary row input. To confirm the detection of cluster based on identical resistance profile, the analysis is on “resistance profile” with “include cluster alerts”. In Figure 1, the specific analysis method to be used is “Space-Time Uniform – Simulated prospective”. The “maximum cluster length” and “baseline data” will be set at 180 days and 730 days respectively. On the other hand, the “recurrence interval” will be set at 365 days and “Monte Carlo simulations” at 9999.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. SaTScan analysis default configuration\n\n\nSaTScan analysis is not limited to the organisms listed in Table 1.  Cluster detection can also be performed on other bacterial species of interest.\nTable 1.

    "text": "Background\nGenomic epidemiology aims to understand the emergence and dissemination of high-risk clones within pathogen populations with the ultimate goal of implementing evidence-based interventions to protect public health. High-risk clones are subpopulations/strains/variants of a pathogen that carry risk elements, such as antibiotic resistance or virulence determinants, and thus pose a potential risk to public health.\nThe increased genetic resolution afforded by genomic data is useful from global to local geographic scales, and has proven to be particularly useful for the investigation of pathogens that exhibit little genetic variation (e.g. Wong et al. 2016), and for outbreak investigations (e.g. Hendriksen et al. 2011, Eppinger et al. 2014). During outbreak investigations (and other genomic epidemiology studies), epidemiological data from patients is collected by healthcare professionals. Antimicrobial susceptibility data, species identification, and any further phenotypic or molecular characterization of the isolates is often generated by the laboratories linked to healthcare facilities and/or by the reference laboratory. Ideally, these different sources of data are stored in a centralised surveillance system and database, such as WHONET. However, these systems rarely incorporate genomic data produced by bioinformaticians. Genomic data may include sequence/assembly quality, genotyping/genoserotyping information, presence/absence of known risk elements, and clustering of the isolates based on genetic similarity –usually in the form of a phylogenetic tree or a minimum spanning-tree.\nThe job of a genomic epidemiologist often starts by combining data from diverse sources that might not be complete or standardised to facilitate the identification of relevant patterns for meaningful interpretation. Once integrated, the epi, lab, and genomic data can be interrogated over the structure of the tree to identify clusters of interest that will place the isolates in or out of the outbreak.\nThe Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance develops free web applications for data collection, integration, visualisation, and analysis of genomic epidemiology data. Epicollect5 is a mobile & web application for free and easy data collection. It provides both the web and mobile applications for the generation of forms (questionnaires) and freely hosted project websites for data collection. Projects are created by using the web application at five.epicollect.net, and then downloaded to the device to perform the data collection. Data are collected in the field using multiple devices and all data can be viewed on a central server (via map, tables, and charts). Pathogenwatch is a free web based tool for processing and visualization of microbial genome sequences in phylogenetic and geographical contexts. First, this genomic tool allows you to upload microbial genomes to access an array of automatic analyses such as species assignment, and antibiotic resistance prediction among others. Microreact allows you to upload, visualise and explore any combination of clustering (trees), geographic (map) and temporal (timeline) data. Other metadata variables are displayed in a table. You can specify colours and/or shapes to display on the map, tree and/or timeline. A permanent URL is produced for you to share your Microreact.\n\n\nTraining Methods and Instructional Strategies\n\nDiscussions, hands-on activities\n\n\n\nDuration of training\n\n10 hours\n\n\n\nResources\nA series of resources will be made available for participants prior, during and after the workshop: quick guide videos/documentation and printed training materials.\n\n\nRecommended background knowledge\n\nBiological and clinical mechanisms underlying infectious pathogens\nInfectious disease epidemiology and surveillance\nDisease outbreaks\nPathogens of clinical significance\nAntimicrobial resistance"
